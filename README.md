You have just to download the 'main.py' file and put it in the same folder of the packages you want to extract.

As you can see, the tool will automatically locate all the archives inside this directory. When you're ready to proceed, just hit ENTER.
(you can change the extraction folder by changing 'EXTRACT_TO' variable inside 'main.py')
